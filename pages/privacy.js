            4 SHARING & DISCLOSURE Sharing With
            Your Consent or at Your Direction. Where you provide consent, we
            share your information as described at the time of consent.
            Advertising and Social Media Where permissible according to
            applicable law we may use certain limited personal information about
            you, such as your email address, to hash it and to share it with
            social media platforms, such as Facebook or Google, to generate
            leads, drive traffic to our websites or otherwise promote the Point
            EU programs. These processing activities are based on our legitimate
            interest in undertaking marketing activities to alert you to
            charitable programs or activities that may be of interest to you.
            The social media platforms with which we may share your personal
            information are not controlled or supervised by Point EU. Therefore,
            any questions regarding how your social media platform service
            provider processes your personal information should be directed to
            that provider. Please note that you may, at any time ask Point EU to
            cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by
            sending an e-mail to pointapp.eu@gmail.com. Compliance with Law, Responding
            to Legal Requests, Preventing Harm and Protection of our Rights.
            Point EU may disclose your information, including personal
            information, to courts, law enforcement, governmental authorities,
            tax authorities, or authorized third parties, if and to the extent
            we are required or permitted to do so by law or if such disclosure
            is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with our legal obligations,
            (ii) to comply with a valid legal request or to respond to claims
            asserted against Point EU, (iii) to respond to a valid legal request
            relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal
            activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other
            of our users to legal liability, (iv) to enforce and administer our
            agreements with users, or (v) to protect the rights, property or
            personal safety of Point EU, its employees, its users, or members of
            the public. These disclosures may be necessary to comply with our
            legal obligations, for the protection of your or another person's
            vital interests or for the purposes of our or a third party’s
            legitimate interest in keeping the Point EU services secure,
            preventing harm or crime, enforcing or defending legal rights, and
            prevention of tax fraud or preventing damage. Where appropriate, we
            may notify users about legal requests unless: (i) providing notice
            is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we
            receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing
            notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or
            bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk
            of fraud upon Point EU’s property, its users and the Point EU
            services. In instances where we comply with legal requests without
            notice for these reasons, we may attempt to notify that user about
            the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine
            in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so. Service
            Providers. In addition to Point providing the Point Platform,
            Point EU also uses a variety of third-party service providers to
            help us provide services related to the Point EU programs. Service
            providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic
            Area (“EEA”). These include financial and legal service providers
            and philanthropy and fundraising consultants. Business Transfers. If
            Point EU undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition,
            reorganization, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or insolvency event,
            then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets,
            including your information in connection with such transaction or in
            contemplation of such transaction (e.g., due diligence). In this
            event, we will notify you before your personal information is
            transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 5
            YOUR RIGHTS Consistent with applicable law, you may exercise the
            rights described in this section. For any personal information that
            was collected and processed via the Point Platform, you should
            exercise your data rights directly via the Point Platform. For any
            personal information collected and processed by Point EU, you may
            exercise your rights by contacting us directly via email at
            DSR@Point EU. Please note that we may ask you to verify your
            identity before taking further action on your request. Data Access
            and Portability. In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle
            you to request certain copies of your personal information held by
            us. You may also be entitled to request copies of personal
            information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly
            used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this
            information to another service provider (where technically
            feasible). Rectification of Inaccurate or Incomplete Information.
            You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete
            personal information about you. Data Retention and Erasure. You have
            the right, in certain cases, to ask us to delete your information,
            provided there are valid grounds for doing so and subject to
            applicable law. Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing.
            If we are processing your personal information based on your consent
            you may withdraw your consent at any time by sending a communication
            to Point EU specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please
            note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the
            lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before
            its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law
            may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your
            personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the
            accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is
            unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information;
            (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes
            of the processing, but you require the information for the
            establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have
            objected to the processing and pending the verification whether the
            legitimate grounds of Point EU override your own. Objection to
            Processing. In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to
            require Point EU not to process your personal information for
            certain specific purposes where such processing is based on
            legitimate interest. If you object to such processing, Point EU will
            no longer process your personal information for these purposes
            unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such
            processing or such processing is required for the establishment,
            exercise or defence of legal claims. Lodging Complaints. You have
            the right to lodge complaints about our data processing activities
            by filing a complaint with our Data Protection Officer, who can be
            reached by the “Contact Us” section below, or with a supervisory
            authority. 6 OPERATING GLOBALLY & INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS Where we
            transfer, store, and process your personal information outside of
            the EEA we have ensured that appropriate safeguards are in place to
            ensure an adequate level of data protection. We rely on Standard
            Contractual Clause approved by the European Commission to transfer
            data from the EEA, Switzerland and other countries outside of where
            you live. You may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses
            by contacting us at DSR@Point EU. 7 SECURITY While no organization
            can guarantee perfect security, we are continuously implementing and
            updating administrative, technical, and physical security measures
            to help protect your information against unauthorized access, loss,
            destruction, or alteration. 8 THIRD PARTY PARTNERS & INTEGRATIONS
            Parts of Point EU may link to third-party services not owned or
            controlled by Point EU, such as the Point Platform or PayPal. Use
            of these services is subject to the privacy policies of those
            providers, such as the Point Terms of Service, the Point Privacy
            Policy, the PayPal User Agreement, and the PayPal Privacy Statement.
            Point EU does not own or control these third parties and when you
            interact with them you are providing your information to them. 9
